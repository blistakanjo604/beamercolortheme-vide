# beamer color theme `vide`

> this is simply based on the `owl` beamer theme with monocolor design.

> nothing crazy about it really‚Ä¶

## installation
installing `vide`, as with any other LaTeX package, involves just three easy steps, and one complicated one:

1. **download the source** however, way you would like üòù  

2. **compile** `beamercolorthemeowl.ins` with LaTeX to produce the package file `beamercolorthemeowl.sty`.


3. **rename the `.sty` file** to `beamercolorthemevide.sty` to avoid conflicts with the original owl theme.


4. **move the `.sty` file** to the folder containing your presentation or a directory in your TeX path.

yup, it's hacky but it works.

have a good day‚Ä¶
